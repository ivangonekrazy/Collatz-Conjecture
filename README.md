## Collatz Conjecture Sequence Generators
#### Ivan Tam (ivangonekrazy@gmail.com)

### What is the Collatz conjecture?
Given a natural number _n_, if _n_ is even, divide it by 2 (_n_ / 2). If it is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 (3(_n_) + 1).
Repeat until you get 1. The Collatz conjecture is that for any natural number _n_, the sequence will eventually lead to 1.

[Another description](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) is available on Wikipedia.

### What's in this repo and Why?
I just thought I'd practice recursion and other language features in a few different languages. These are also
studies in various ways to optimize the generatin of the sequence.
